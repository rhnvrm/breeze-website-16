# Calling For Duty: Allied Cabinet

Set in an atmosphere similar to that of the popular video game: Call of Duty, at the time of World War II, the event is a one cabinet Joint Crisis Cabinet, with all delegates collectively representing the Allies and the executive board delivering updates about the actions of the opposing cabinet: the Axis. Participants will be periodically given missions that they must complete while all the time having the overall mission of winning the war. They must respond to updates of the war and formulate strategies in response. Actions they can take include movement of troops, usage of weapons, etc, which they will do by the submission of directives and plans of action. Time will be fluid and by the end of the event we shall have rewritten history with a new course and outcome of WW2.

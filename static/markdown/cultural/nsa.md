# No strings Attached 

NO STRINGS ATTACHED is an A Capella competition. This is one competition that is going to test the limits of your everyday, menial task of putting your vocal chords to use by showcasing your ability to produce music entirely by your voices. So, tighten your vocal chords, get your chords right and prepare your throats for a battle of only voices. It is time for the music nerds to shine and for that adam’s apple to turn into bass beats. Brownie points if you do a video game themed A Capella. Hit us with your best routines and captivate us with your vocal acrobatics.

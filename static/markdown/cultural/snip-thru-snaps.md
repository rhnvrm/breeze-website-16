The participants will have to use newspaper cut-outs to create a picture story, which will supplement the main write-up. The write-up will be a video-game plot (which needs to be unique). The story along with the pictures should be completely eye catching and should be appealing to the reader in all aspects- gripping, interesting and the style of writing and reporting incorporated. Participants will be judged on their ideas and their ability to craft an amazing front page story that describes a video game plot. Participants will be provided with a copy of the newspaper (a random main edition of TOI or HT; the newspaper given will be same for all the teams). They have to select the apt combination of pictures and weave a video-game plot in accordance with the pictures.

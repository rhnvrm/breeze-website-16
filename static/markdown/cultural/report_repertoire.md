
# Report Repertoire

This is a verbal reporting event, wherein participants will be required to simultaneously report while a video clip will be played at the background. Keeping in mind the theme for this yearâ€™s Breeze, we have decided that the video clip to be reported to will be a short scene from a video game. While reporting, we expect the participants to maintain a journalistic style of reporting as seen in News Channels. 

## Prize Money

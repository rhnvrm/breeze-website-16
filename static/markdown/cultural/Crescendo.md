# Crescendo

A boisterous battle of bands to rock the stage to glory. Sound-checks, head-bangs, some splendid strummin’ and some awesome music runnin’ and not to forget the excited crowd, swaying to the rhythm divine, coupled with a fabulous frenzy of endless cheering… CRESCENDO is a competition for the title of the “Best Band”, the most prestigious musical event of the festival. Usually rock/metal bands take the lead and make the crowd go crazy with their performances. However, there is no limitation on the genre of music played. So folks, get ready for an amazing time and for all the bands who wish to participate - we can’t wait to hear you!

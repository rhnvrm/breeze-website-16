Cryptex is words.Ink’s annual treasure hunt. The event is, in the simplest of terms, a clue-solving race. It is an event aimed at bringing out the Sherlock in you, except that in this event, Sherlock is forbidden to work alone. Participants form teams of 4. Each team will receive a clue card at the start of the event. The clue card is formatted thusly: On the card, is a ciphertext, i.e. text modified using some method of ciphering/encryption. To help you solve the ciphertext, a hint will be provided on the card in plaintext. On solving the cipher using the hint, a riddle is revealed. This riddle has exactly one answer. Teams must return to the event venue and tell the words.Ink volunteer the answer to the riddle to receive the next clue card. This process continues with similarly formatted clue cards, till any one team solves the riddle on the final clue card.

# Puzzle Master

This event requires no pre-requisite knowledge, only basic arithmetic and logical reasoning. Participants (single/teams of two) will compete in 3 rounds against each other and against time to solve logical puzzles and riddles to win the grand prize.

Those eliminated at the end of first round will have a chance to try their luck and earn big by buying the stocks of teams still competing for glory. Each disqualified player, irrespective of their team member, will start with some initial virtual money which they can invest on team stocks any time until the start of the third round.

We would also conduct a half an hour-long workshop before the start of the event to give practice puzzles and any clarifications about the rules

## Prize Money (Cash)

* First Prize - 3000

# DIY Hard

“The bat claw is a grapple gun modification that helped batman to grapple things out of reach”


A Bat Claw is a machine which can throw a projectile (tied with rope) which can attach to the target. Once attached the machine should be capable to pull the target object towards itself.

The teams will be expected to construct a grapple gun from the DIY kit provided and complete tasks given during the event.

This event is open for all students irrespective of their stream and is aimed to have the excitement of building a working machine and teamwork that will go into completing the tasks.

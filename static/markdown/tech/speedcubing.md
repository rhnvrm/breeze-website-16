## Rules

* The cube will be scrambled and hidden at the start of the game.
*  They will be given 8 seconds to see it before the timer starts.
*   Once done, they are not supposed to throw the cube and if the cube is thrown or fallen by chance, it will invite penalty of 2 seconds.
*    Also, if one of the edges are twisted over 45 degrees, 2 seconds will be added to their time.
*    The fastest one wins.
